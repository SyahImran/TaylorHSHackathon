KEYBOARD
 
 Use number commands to input values of the Principal (P),
 Interest Rate(R),Number of times interest is compounded
 (n), and Time (t in years).

MOUSE

 It is expected that the left mouse button can facilitate the
 acts of clearing the inputs, which is, setting them to zeros
 (0) and can launch the act of running the calculation and 
 displaying a graph. There should be no use of the right mouse
 button.
